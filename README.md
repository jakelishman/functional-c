# functional-c

For some basic high-level functions in C, here's your solution!  With versions
of Array.map, Array.iter, Array.fold, Array.reduce, and of course the indexed
versions of the former 3, you too can now write elegant and wonderful functional
constructs in C!

Naturally, fold, reduce and iter are all defined recursively, since this is,
after all, a functional library.

(Please note: this is 100% a joke.  Please don't actually use this.)
